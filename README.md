# 🏆 HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank coding challenges, organized by difficulty and topic. It's intended as both a portfolio of problem-solving skills and a learning reference.

---
## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- **C++** — core solutions using STL and custom logic  
- **Java / JavaScript** or other languages (if included)  
- **HackerRank challenge descriptions** — problem statements

---
## ✅ How to Use / Run

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bola-nabil/HackerRank-Solutions.git
```

---
## 📚 Goals & Objectives

- Solidify understanding of algorithms & data structures
- Practice problem-solving under constraints (time, memory)
- Explore multiple coding languages and styles
- Build a reference portfolio of clean, documented solutions
- Prepare for coding interviews

---
🚀 Roadmap / Future Plans

- Add explanation / commentary for each solution
- Group by topic (Arrays, Strings, Graphs, DP, etc.)
- Introduce unit tests or test harnesses
- Measure time & space complexity in comments
- Add comparison benchmarks where relevant
- Continuously solve new challenges & expand coverage
